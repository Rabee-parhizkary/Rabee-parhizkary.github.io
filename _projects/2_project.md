<p align="justify"> In this project, we  aimed to enhance an existing facial expression similarity analysis method, originally proposed by Raviteja Vemulapalli and Aseem Agarwala. Our method focuses on two main areas: improving the pretraining model for face detection and experimenting with different neural network architectures to boost performance. We used face detection models like Viola-Jones and MTCNN to preprocess the facial images. Then we implemented DenseNet architectures, including variations such as AttentionDenseNet and SkipDenseNet, to improve the model's accuracy. The evaluation involved comparing these models' performance in terms of accuracy and loss, using metrics derived from experiments on a facial expression dataset. Our results conclude by comparing different architectures, demonstrating the potential of the enhanced model in handling facial expression similarity.  </p>
