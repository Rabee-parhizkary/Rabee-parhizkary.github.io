<p align="justify"> In the project "A Compact Embedding for Facial Expression Similarity," we aimed to improve the existing method for facial expression similarity analysis initially proposed by Raviteja Vemulapalli and Aseem Agarwala. Our focus was on enhancing the pretraining step by incorporating more efficient face detection models like MTCNN, and experimenting with various neural network architectures to achieve better results. We implemented and tested models like AttentionDenseNet and SkipDenseNet to improve accuracy in facial expression recognition tasks. To evaluate our work, we used a facial expression dataset and compared the performance of these architectures based on metrics such as accuracy and loss. Our results demonstrated that our enhanced models were more effective in handling facial expression similarity, offering promising advancements in this field.</p>
