<p align="justify">Hi, I'm Rabee Parhizkari, a senior undergraduate student studying computer science at Sharif University of Technology, one of Iran's top universities. I'm excited to begin my graduate studies in the fall of 2025. My love for mathematics started in high school, where my dedication led to a national bronze medal in the International Olympiad. This strong math foundation paved the way for my growing interest in computer science, particularly in machine learning and bioinformatics. Machine learning excites me because it can unlock powerful insights from data, and bioinformatics has sparked my curiosity for its potential to solve fascinating biological problems through computation. University life has also taught me the value of teamwork—whether it’s living in a dorm with five other people or working on group projects, I’ve learned how to collaborate, resolve conflicts, and appreciate different perspectives. I'm now looking for graduate positions that will allow me to pursue my passion for machine learning and deep learning and learn from and collaborate with other researchers and experts in the field. I am eager to apply his knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems and positively impact society.</p>
