      year: 2024
      description: |
        Traffic project for Data Analysis and Regression course (Prof.Kasra Alishahi). We wanted to determine the most traveled city during Nowrouz in North of Iran. We had the data of cars that entered or left for each town hourly and daily. We determined whether a town had a lot of entrances because itâ€™s merely between two towns or a tourist destination. Lastly, we determined the touristic cities using clustering and hypothesis testing.
